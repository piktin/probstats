Final assignment for the module Probability and Statistic from the University of Edinburgh.

This assignment is assessed on statistical testing and regression modelling using R. Dataset is from a research project from two Scandinavian university hospitals concerning with pain and biomarkers. It is unknown whether increases or decreases in these biomarker values cause more pain. I needed to manipulate the datasets in various ways using R and subsequently analyze the data using hypothesis testing and drawing conclusion using multiple hypothesis testing.

Part 2 of the assignment involved building a regression model using the 12-month VAS as the response variable and biomarker levels (at inclusion) and covariates as explanatory variables. This model was then used to predict the 12-month VAS. Finally, the model is evaluated based on its statistical summary values.
